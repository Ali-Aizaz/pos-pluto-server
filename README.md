# pos-pluto-server

pos-pluto-server is the backend for the pos-pluto project, which utilizes a variety of tools and techniques to create a custom POS (point of sale) builder. This project is built using Express, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs. It also uses Prisma, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for managing database interactions, MongoDB, a NoSQL document-based database, and Zod, a library for data validation.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Express:** This project is built using Express, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs. Express provides a robust set of features for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
- **Prisma:** This project uses Prisma, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for managing database interactions. Prisma allows you to define your database schema using a declarative syntax and generates type-safe database access code for you.
- **MongoDB:** This project uses MongoDB, a NoSQL document-based database. MongoDB allows you to store and retrieve data in a flexible and scalable manner, making it an ideal choice for web development projects.
- **Zod:** This project uses Zod, a library for data validation. Zod allows you to define complex validation rules for your data and ensures that user input is valid before submitting it to your server.
- **Other Dependencies:** This project also uses several other dependencies, including Axios for making HTTP requests, Bcrypt for password hashing, Cors for enabling cross-origin resource sharing, Dotenv for managing environment variables, JSON Web Token for authentication, Nodemailer for sending emails, and more.
